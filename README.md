The Firepear Javascript Library
===============================

I don't always write Javascript, but when I do it ends up in this repo.

What's here:

  * `blades.js`, A bladed UI component
  * `chunker.js`, A utility class which turns strings into chunks of data
  * `slideshow.js`, A self-loading, self-contained slide deck viewer.

User-oriented documentation is in the `docs` directory, in markdown
format.
